# Zeroway - URL Parameter Finder
Zeroway is an automation tool designed to find hidden URL parameters from web archives using various tools such as `waybackurls`, `gau`, and `hakrawler`. This tool is useful for pentesters and bug hunters to explore hidden parameters that may be vulnerable to security attacks.

## Features
- **Automated URL Discovery:** Uses waybackurls, gau, and hakrawler to collect URLs.
- **Parameter Extraction:** Filters URLs with query parameters and extracts them uniquely.
